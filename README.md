# Haclytics2025_AssurantChallenge1

Welcome to the Haclytics2025_AssurantChallenge1 project! This project uses a machine learning (ML) model to analyze data and make predictions. The following sections explain the project in terms that suit both a curious middle school student and a professional data scientist.

## Project Overview

Our ML model learns from data. Imagine it like a smart robot that figures out patterns in a puzzleâ€”it keeps getting better as it practices. For data scientists, the model uses advanced algorithms and statistical techniques to identify trends and make reliable predictions.

## How the ML Model Works

### Explanation for a Middle School Student
Think of the ML model like a smart friend who gets really good at solving puzzles. At first, the puzzle pieces are all mixed up. By looking closely at each piece, the model learns where the pieces might fit. Over time, it recognizes patterns and improves its ability to solve new puzzles, much like how you get better at a video game or a sport with practice.

### Explanation for a Data Scientist
The ML model begins with data collection and preprocessing, including cleaning and feature engineering, to ensure quality inputs. We apply supervised learning methods, training the model on labeled data using algorithms such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, or Deep Neural Networks. The training phase involves optimizing a loss function via gradient descent, with careful hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to avoid overfitting. Post-training, we deploy model explainability tools like SHAP values to interpret feature importance and validate our predictions using confusion matrices and other evaluation metrics.
